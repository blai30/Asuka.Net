##   Note about relative and absolute paths:
##      The liquibase.properties file requires paths for some properties.
##      The classpath is the path/to/resources (ex. src/main/resources).
##      The changeLogFile path is relative to the classpath.
##      The url H2 example below is relative to 'pwd' resource.

# Logging Configuration
# logLevel controls the amount of logging information generated. If not set, the default logLevel is INFO.
# Valid values, from least amount of logging to most, are:
#   OFF, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE, ALL
# If you are having problems, setting the logLevel to DEBUG and re-running the command can be helpful.
# logLevel: DEBUG

# The logFile property controls where logging messages are sent. If this is not set, then logging messages are
# displayed on the console. If this is set, then messages will be sent to a file with the given name.
# logFile: liquibase.log
